# cronjob Backup #
A backup of parts of my dev setup using automatic pushes with a cronjob. Designed to:
* Simplify sharing my dev setup with others 
* Easily move onto new machines and get working quickly
* Make restoration easier in case I mess something up switching setups, or sharing practices easier.

I'm someone that really needs things to be functional, well designed, and aesthetically pleasing for me to sit and use it for hours. Because of this, I've spent a lot of time customizing Sublime, Atom, iTerm2, vim, zsh, and more. If you want your setup to look something like this:

And have lots of extra productivity features, try out my setup! Or, check below to read about how I went about setting some (but not all) of these customizations up, or to see how you can create your own cronjob backup to github!
