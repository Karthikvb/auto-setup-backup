# cronjob Backup #
A backup of parts of my dev setup using automatic pushes with a cronjob. Designed to:
* Simplify sharing my dev setup with others
* Speed transition onto new machines and get working quickly
* Make restoration easier in case I mess something up switching setups, or sharing practices easier.

I'm someone that really needs things to be functional, well designed, and aesthetically pleasing for me to sit and use it for hours. Because of this, I've spent a lot of time customizing Sublime, Atom, iTerm2, vim, zsh, and more. If you want your setup to look something like this:

And have lots of extra productivity features, try out my setup! Or, check below to read about how I went about setting some (but not all) of these customizations up, or to see how you can create your own cronjob backup to github!

##iTerm2 setup##
The great thing though is that iTerm stores all of the below listed shortcuts, color schemes, and more in a .plist file, so feel free to use mine as a basis for your setup.

###Weird hex codes###
I'm a huge supporter of keyboard commands, so I found it unfortunate when iTerm didn't respond well to most of my usual OS X keybindings. Luckily everything I wanted could be added to iTerm, but it required a bit of googling and learning about iTerm's hex code commands.

Some of the most important ones:
- `alt + arrows` for jumping one word back
  - Profiles > Keys > '+' > Send Escape Sequence > b
- `alt + arrows` for jumping one word forward
  - Profiles > Keys > '+' > Send Escape Sequence > f
- `cmd + del` for deleting all of line behind the cursor
  - Profiles > Keys > '+' > Send Hex Code > 0x18 0x7f
  - As a side note, if you run zsh you will need to run `echo 'bindkey "^X\\x7f" backward-kill-line' >> ~/.zshrc` to have this work properly

There are plenty of other bindings to add â€“ if something doesn't work how you want it to, iTerm can probably be made to do it. Try googling it!

###Color schemes###
Especially because I use vim a lot, and am also frequently working over ssh, I end up starting at my terminal a lot. That means I need something that is easy on the eyes, has good color differentiation, and is very readable (even when my eyes are tired and I've taken off my contacts.)

###Fonts###
I use 12pt 'Hack' and 12pt 'Source Code Powerline' for non-ASCII text. Hack is incredibly readable, which the other font has a wide symbol library that I like for plugins like Powerline.
