# cronjob Backup
A backup of parts of my dev setup using automatic pushes with a cronjob. Designed to:
* Simplify sharing my dev setup with others 
* Easily move onto new machines and get working quickly
* Make restoration easier in case I mess something up switching setups, or sharing practices easier.
